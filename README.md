An in-browser video chat service using PeerJS and WebRTC. I got about 70% of the way into this project and then found a handful of companies doing the same thing but better. I also don't think that browser connections are where they need to be to make this work flawlessly. 

Obviously, the ultimate goal is to not use little NSA-helper services (*cough mcrsft/gogl). 

Anyways, I'm using PeerJS, Express, Socket.io and NodeJs on Heroku.

Getting it to run with Heroku's websockets was shitty.

Feel free to check out the issues and fork it if you want to.
